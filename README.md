# Lux-Data-Academy-Bootcamp-2024
This is a repo for the Bootcamp starting on 29th July 2024. Basicaly, the first files will be this README markdown which will contain general information about the project, a csv file containing weather data obtained from Kaggle and a jupyter python file for Week 1 project (basic analysis of the dataset).
I will be updating this markup file as the bootcamp goes on.
